# Workout Planner

A single page web application with how-to workout videos to help users streamline their daily exercise routines.

A user can log in or create an account.
Upon logging in, the user is directed to a page with workout videos that they can filter by muscle groups using the radio buttons.
The user is able to view more information about the workout video by clicking on the Show Details button, which leads to a details page.
The user is able to title a routine and select however many videos to create a new routine.
When a new routine is created, the user is directed to the My Routines page which has a list of all their routines by title and date created.
When the user clicks on a routine title, it goes to a page with all the workout videos that the user has selected for that routine.
